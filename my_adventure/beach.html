       <p>You're at the beach and it's super crowded.  There is a designated swimming area, but it's full of people.  Over to the right, there is an open, pristine spot for swimming but it's known for its strong current and rocky bottom.  It's also strictly off limits, but you are pretty sure you will be ok if you're careful.  But, you also don't want to break the rules.  Do you want to stay in the safe, crowded swimming area or do you take the risk?</p>
