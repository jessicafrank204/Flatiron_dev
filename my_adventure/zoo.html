      <p>You are on a zoo tour.  Right now, you are in the sea lions exhibit, which is right next to the killer whale exhibit, your favorite.  You see that your favorite exhibit at the zoo is closed because one kid was eaten by a killer whale!  But, there is an opening through the fensed off area.  You look around and no one seems to be watching.  The rest of your zoo tour is going to visit the snail exhibit and they're leaving now.  You must make a choice.  Do you continue with your group to the snail exhibit or do you take the risk and slip into the killer whale exhibit? </p>
